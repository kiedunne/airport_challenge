##Airport challenge attempt##

The current version is unfinished. The current version does not pass tests whenever the take_off method is called for a plane. I was having an issue with calling this method on an array and couldn't figure out how to solve it. I also was having issues with raising errors for the weather. If I had more time, I would move more tests to the plane_spec.rb file and make the tests more specific. Planes are also by default flying, if I had more time, I would make them be landed at the airport by default.
